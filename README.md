# Papollo-Healthcare-Dashboard Using Power-BI


## Project Overview
This project involves the creation of a Power BI dashboard to visualize and analyze patient data for Papollo Hospitals. The dashboard provides insights into various metrics such as bed occupancy, bill amounts, health insurance amounts, and diagnosis-wise patient counts. The dashboard also includes a patient ID slicer for filtering data.

## Objectives
- To provide a comprehensive view of hospital operations and patient data.
- To enable data-driven decision-making for hospital management.
- To visualize key metrics in an interactive and user-friendly manner.
- To allow filtering of data using the Patient ID slicer for detailed analysis.

## Description
The Power BI dashboard is designed to help hospital administrators and stakeholders monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) related to patient admissions, discharges, and follow-ups. The dashboard includes visualizations for:
- **Bed Occupancy**: Tracks the number of beds occupied in different categories (Private, General, ICU).
- **Bill Amount vs. Health Insurance Amount**: Compares the total bill amount with the health insurance amount.
- **Diagnosis-wise Patient Count**: Shows the distribution of patients based on their diagnoses (e.g., Viral Infection, Flu, Malaria, etc.).
- **Feedback Volume per Doctor**: Displays the volume of feedback received per doctor.


## Conclusion
The Papollo Hospitals Leads Flow Dashboard is a powerful tool for monitoring and analyzing hospital data. By leveraging Power BI's interactive features, the dashboard provides actionable insights that can help improve hospital operations and patient care. The ability to filter data using the Patient ID slicer adds an extra layer of detail, making it easier for stakeholders to drill down into specific patient records.
